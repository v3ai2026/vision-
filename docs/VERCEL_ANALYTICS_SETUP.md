# Getting started with Vercel Web Analytics

This guide will help you get started with using Vercel Web Analytics on your project, showing you how to enable it, add the package to your project, deploy your app to Vercel, and view your data in the dashboard.

**Select your framework to view instructions on using the Vercel Web Analytics in your project**.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for free](https://vercel.com/signup).
- A Vercel project. If you don't have one, you can [create a new project](https://vercel.com/new).
- The Vercel CLI installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command:

  ```bash
  # Using pnpm
  pnpm i vercel
  
  # Using yarn
  yarn i vercel
  
  # Using npm
  npm i vercel
  
  # Using bun
  bun i vercel
  ```

## Enable Web Analytics in Vercel

On the [Vercel dashboard](/dashboard), select your Project and then click the **Analytics** tab and click **Enable** from the dialog.

> **💡 Note:** Enabling Web Analytics will add new routes (scoped at `/_vercel/insights/*`) after your next deployment.

## Add `@vercel/analytics` to your project

Using the package manager of your choice, add the `@vercel/analytics` package to your project:

```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm i @vercel/analytics

# Using yarn
yarn i @vercel/analytics

# Using npm
npm i @vercel/analytics

# Using bun
bun i @vercel/analytics
```

## Add the `Analytics` component to your app

Since this is a React application built with Vite, add the `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react` to your main app component.

The `Analytics` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with React.

> **💡 Note:** When using the plain React implementation, there is no route support.

Add the following code to your main app file (`App.tsx`):

```tsx
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your app content */}
      <Analytics />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Or if you prefer JavaScript:

```jsx
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your app content */}
      <Analytics />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deploy your app to Vercel

Deploy your app using the following command:

```bash
vercel deploy
```

If you haven't already, we also recommend [connecting your project's Git repository](/docs/git#deploying-a-git-repository), which will enable Vercel to deploy your latest commits to main without terminal commands.

Once your app is deployed, it will start tracking visitors and page views.

> **💡 Note:** If everything is set up properly, you should be able to see a Fetch/XHR request in your browser's Network tab from `/_vercel/insights/view` when you visit any page.

## View your data in the dashboard

Once your app is deployed, and users have visited your site, you can view your data in the dashboard.

To do so, go to your [dashboard](/dashboard), select your project, and click the **Analytics** tab.

After a few days of visitors, you'll be able to start exploring your data by viewing and [filtering](/docs/analytics/filtering) the panels.

Users on Pro and Enterprise plans can also add [custom events](/docs/analytics/custom-events) to their data to track user interactions such as button clicks, form submissions, or purchases.
